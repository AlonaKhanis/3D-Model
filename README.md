# Hookah 3D Model Viewer

This project demonstrates a `model-viewer` implementation for showcasing a 3D model of a hookah. Users can interact with the model by zooming in and out, and viewing it from all angles. The project features a card-based layout with an interactive modal window for the 3D model.

## Features

- **3D Model Viewer:** Displays a 3D model of a hookah.
- **Card Interface:** Shows the hookah model on a card.
- **Interactive Modal:** Opens a modal window for a detailed view of the 3D model.
- **Zoom and Rotate:** Allows users to zoom in/out and rotate the model to view it from different angles.



2. **Open Your Browser:**
   Navigate to `alonakhanis.github.io/3D-Model/` to view the application.

3. **Interact with the Hookah Model:**
   - Click on the hookah card to open the 3D model in a modal.
   - Use mouse controls to zoom in/out and rotate the model.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For front-end development.
- **`model-viewer`:** Web component for displaying 3D models.
- **React:** For building the user interface.
